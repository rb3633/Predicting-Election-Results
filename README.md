Predicting US Presidential Elections at county level based on geo-tagged tweets from Twitter

Abstract

For a long time, forecasting political elections has received a lot of attention. Poll surveys and 
national economic growth are commonly used as predictors in traditional political science election 
forecasting models. However, dense polling is costly. In recent decades, social media has grown 
exponentially, attracting research from a wide range of disciplines. Existing research indicates that 
social media data, particularly Twitter data, may reflect the political landscape and has been used 
to predict global election outcomes. In my machine learning models, I have incorporated Twitter sentiment-based 
support rates as well as GDP data at the county level. The dependent variable is the actual voting 
outcome. Models trained include Logistic Regression, K-NN, Random Forest, and Support Vector Classifier 
(SVC) models on 2012 and 2016 election results and tested them on 2020 data. The resultant models 
achieved an accuracy between 69% and 74%.
